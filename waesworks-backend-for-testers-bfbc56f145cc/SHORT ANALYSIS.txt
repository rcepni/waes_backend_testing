SHORT ANALYSIS

- I have kept most of the related methods and classes orginized in the proper packages

 src/test/java has all java related packages, such as
 
 		- beans (Pojo clases for seriliazation  and deseriliazation (still cannot pronunce or spell these correctly :)
 		- runners
 		- step definitions of cucumber files by using related names
 		- utilities for any useful methods 
 		
 src/test/resources has all feature files
 
 		- Normally I should have created all non Java files (properties, csv ..) under this branch 
 		however I saved some time by keeping them all in project level (did not worry about their path for now)
 
 target folder has maven and reporting related files.
 
 		-No need to worry about other reports such as default-cucumber-report. This is very plain report and does not show much details.
 		-cucumber-html-reports folder all you need about reporting. It can save JSON, XML, jpeg ,... files as part of the report in embeddings 
 			folder. However I printed them into report instead of saving them as separate files. It could have been done easily, if needed.
